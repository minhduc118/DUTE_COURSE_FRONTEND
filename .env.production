# Production Environment
# This file is used when building for production (npm run build)
# Update this URL to match your production backend API endpoint

# Example: https://api.yourdomain.com (without trailing slash)
# For local Docker testing with Nginx on port 8081:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8081

# For Docker deployment with Nginx proxy, you can use:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com
# (Nginx will proxy /api requests to the backend)
